this is a nice simple repo for runing a server I am doing as a side project 

LIMITATIONS:
time zone support is not fully implemented (tools to add it are there tho)
post crash initiliation may mess the order of messages giving a diffrent answer

TODO:
add length constraints and checks for the input 
remove the halusinations made from the autocomplete behvior
